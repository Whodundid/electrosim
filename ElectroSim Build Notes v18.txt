ElectroSim Build Notes
Author: Hunter Troy Bragg
build number: 18
build date: 3-19-2017
----------------------------------------------------------------
Main additions and changes:

-Rewrote visual points entirely.
	-Points are now independent objects extended from 
	 JLabels.
-Removed PointLinkManager and moved point linking directly into 
 the object point class.
-Point rotation and rotated images now can support north, east,
 south, and west rotations and properly display their rotated
 picture inside of a bounding box that fits the image's bounds.
-Objects now account for having an odd or even number of input
 or output points.
	-If there are an even number of points in either inputs 
	 or outputs, a gap is placed in the middle of the drawn 
	 points to account for the lack of a middle point.
-A file can now be directly loaded into the design creator upon
 program startup.
	-This makes testing specific circuits much faster.
	-If a file is loaded, a default tab is not created.
-NumberedHashMaps are now parametized.
	-This removes the need to always make a cast when
	 retrieving a variable.
-NumberedHashMaps now truly support any type of object.
-NumberedHashMaps now have the ability to print out all of their
 contents for debug purposes.
-Rewrote all of VisualGUI.
	-Reorganized all of VisualGUI's contents into their own
	 separate classes.
	 	-These classes consist of the following:
	 		-VisualMenus (package)
	 			-DesignExplorer
	 			-EditMenu
	 			-FileMenu
	 			-PartList
	 			-SimMenu
	 			-SimulatorMenuBar
	 			-UtilitiesMenu
	 		-VisualPartButtons (package)
	 			-Parts
-Objects can now be double clicked to bring up a properties menu.
	-Lever does not support this feature.
-Added a yes or no dialog box which appears when attempting to
 save over an already existing file.
	-Saving from the console uses the previous method where
	 file overwriting is handled through the console.
-When a file is saved, the saved name now is set as both the tab
 name and the DesignPanel's name.
-When hovering over the close button on a design tab, the button
 now gives visual feedback.
-File_Close now closes the currently selected DesignTab.
-Moved general object classes such as SimObject, ObjectTypes,
 GateTypes, ect. into the base placeable package.
-Moved the NumberedHashMap into simUtil as it is a global sim
 utility object.
-Added a 'Save as..." button in the file menu which performs the
 same function as the save button did.
-The 'Save' file button now will try to save the current tab in
 the same directory that the file is. If the current tab has
 never been saved anywhere, then it will bring up the file
 chooser to select a place to save it.
 
----------------------------------------------------------------
Currently in progress additions and changes:

-Rewriting link physics to account for wire values.
	-Points connected to wires should all have the same 
	 value as the wire's output value.
	-A wire's output value is 1 if any of it's connections
	 output's are a 1.
-Rewriting each SimObject to account for not only it's own local
 logic, but also any wires connected to the SimObject's output
 poitns.
-Rewriting links to be based off of individual object point
 values instead of the object's global output value.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Known bugs in build:

-(Fixed) Part ID doesn't show up in properties menu for loaded 
 files.
-When saving a file that is going to overwrite an already
 existing file, if the file chooser is closed with the 'x',
 whatever path was set in the chooser is still passed to the
 design saver.
 	-A check needs to be made to see if the close button is
 	 pressed and if so, don't run the design saver.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed bugs from previous builds:

-Fixed points loosing their selection status when moving an
 object quickly.
-Fixed points not remembering if they are selected when moving 
 the mouse over them.
-Fixed object points not being properly aligned to the grid if
 there were more than three input or output points.
-When saving a file, the final directory the saver ended at was
 not storred as the current directory.
-Fixed a bug when loading a file where the Y position for a
 loaded object would be set to -1 by default.
-Fixed being able to open multiple properties menus for one
 object.
-Fixed a bug where when closing a design tab, it would close 
 the tab currently selected but not necessarily the one that was
 pressed.
-Fixed a bug when saving a file where if the saver was exited,
 a null pointer would be thrown.
-Fixed levers being visuall selected when loading a schematic.
-Fixed douts being deselected when updating their visual.
-Fixed a crucial bug where when loading a file, the loader would 
 skip over lines after reading the "IV" loader instruction. 
 Ultimately this corrupted the circuit upon load. It's honestly 
 magical that files could even be properly loaded before. 

----------------------------------------------------------------
Additional notes:

-Classes which still require rewrites:
	-All SimObject's
