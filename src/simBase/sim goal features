Sim features
------------
1. Ability to work in both a 2d and 3d environment
2. test circuits on both a digital and analog level
3. work on specific levels of a pcb
4. customize specific object propigation delay
5. import exsiting electronic devices
6. create new electronic devices and utilize that device as an individual part in editor
7. support full electricity (volts, current, resistance, inductance, capacitance, ect.)
8. modify design to randomize all specific part types (resistors, inductors, capacitors, ect.) values to fall within a threshold margin.
	This will simulate more of a realistic environment where all parts are not a fixed value across the board.
9. work with PLCs in design and edit ladder logic of part within.
10. export a design to be able to be manufactured
